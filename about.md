<h3 color="white" !important>Hello,</h3>

<p>
  My name is <b>Dimitris Kokkaliaroglou</b>, and I'm an independent game developer from Greece. 
  While I wear many hats, my main focus is games programming and design using C# and the Unity game engine.
</p>
<p>
  Projects I've worked on include both standalone <i>and</i> jam games <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/game_projects" target="_blank">here</a>.
  Occasionally, <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/game_projects" target="_blank">I dabble with proof-of-concept mechanics or recreations from other games</a> 
  to sharpen my skills -- or simply for fun.
</p>
<p>
  I also love writing about games, so in my <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/blog" target="_blank">Blog</a> you can find 
  personal devlogs, thoughts about design and technical analyses of other games.
</p>
