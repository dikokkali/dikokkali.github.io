<h3 color="white">Hello,</h3>

<p>
  My name is <b>Dimitris Kokkaliaroglou</b>, and I'm an independent game developer from Greece. 
  While I wear many hats, my main focus is games programming and design using C# and the Unity game engine.
</p>
<p>
  I also love writing about games, so in my <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/blog">Blog</a> you can find 
  personal devlogs, thoughts about design and technical analyses of other games.
