## Hello


  My name is **Dimitris Kokkaliaroglou**, and I'm an independent game developer from Greece. 
  While I wear many hats, my main focus is games programming and design using **C#** and the **Unity** game engine.


  <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/game_projects" target="_blank">Projects</a> I've worked on include both standalone _and_ jam games. Occasionally, I dabble with 
  <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/game_projects" target="_blank">proof-of-concept mechanics</a> or recreations from other games
  to sharpen my skills -- or simply for fun.


  I also love writing about games, so in my <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/blog" target="_blank">Blog</a> you can find 
  personal devlogs, thoughts about design and technical analyses of other games.
