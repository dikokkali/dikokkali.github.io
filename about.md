##Hello


  My name is <b>Dimitris Kokkaliaroglou</b>, and I'm an independent game developer from Greece. 
  While I wear many hats, my main focus is games programming and design using <b>C#</b> and the <b>Unity</b> game engine.


  <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/game_projects" target="_blank">Projects</a> I've worked on include both standalone <i>and</i> jam games. Occasionally, I dabble with 
  <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/game_projects" target="_blank">proof-of-concept mechanics</a> or recreations from other games
  to sharpen my skills -- or simply for fun.

<p>
  I also love writing about games, so in my <a href="https://dikokkali.github.io/blog" target="_blank">Blog</a> you can find 
  personal devlogs, thoughts about design and technical analyses of other games.
</p>
